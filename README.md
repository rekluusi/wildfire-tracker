# Wildfire Tracker

> This is a React app to track wildfires and show them on a Google map. The point of this app was to train JS and learning the use of APIs. Thanks to Brad Traversy for inspiration and guidance.

## Usage

```
npm install
npm start

# Build
npm run build
or
yarn build
```

## API Keys

I have removed my own API key from the code, so you will need to add your own Google Maps API key to Map.js if you want to view the map properly.
